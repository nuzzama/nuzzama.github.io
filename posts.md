Last week, I had the opportunity to attend the AIAA Aviation Forum 2025 in Las Vegas, which was co-located with AIAA ASCEND 2025â€”together making for a vibrant and impactful event.

I was honored to present my paper:
 "Multiple Model Unscented Kalman Smoother for Improved Wind Estimation by a Quadcopter."
A heartfelt thank you to my advisor, Dr. He Bai, for his continuous support and guidance throughout this work.

It was a fantastic experience to share my research, engage in insightful discussions, and connect with brilliant minds from both academia and industry. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to contribute, learn, and be inspired.

Excited to have presented our paper at the ACC 2023-64th American Control Conference!

It was an honor to be part of this event, which is considered one of the biggest and most prestigious conferences in the control community. I had the pleasure of connecting with brilliant researchers from both industry and academia, exchanging ideas and insights. Thank you to everyone who made this experience unforgettable!

I am pleased to share that I got the 'Best Poster Presentation' award at the 4th Annual MAE Graduate Research Symposium. 

This event is organized by Oklahoma State University with the collaboration of other regional Universities. I presented a poster with my work on state-dependent noise covariance prediction using the Wishart process, which is a Bayesian Machine Learning technique for predicting positive definite matrices.
