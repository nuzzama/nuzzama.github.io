Last week, I had the opportunity to attend the AIAA Aviation Forum 2025 in Las Vegas, which was co-located with AIAA ASCEND 2025â€”together making for a vibrant and impactful event.

I was honored to present my paper:
 "Multiple Model Unscented Kalman Smoother for Improved Wind Estimation by a Quadcopter."
A heartfelt thank you to my advisor, Dr. He Bai, for his continuous support and guidance throughout this work.

It was a fantastic experience to share my research, engage in insightful discussions, and connect with brilliant minds from both academia and industry. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to contribute, learn, and be inspired.
